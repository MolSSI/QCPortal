A client interface to the QC Archive Project.

This standalone client serves to hook into QCFractal instances from remote or local 
locations and is designed for end-users who which to access the QCFractal stores.

The main source code for this project is automatically ported over from the 
[QCFractal](https://github.com/molssi/qcfractal) automatically. Issues involving 
the source code itself (anything in the `qcfractal` directory) should raise an issue 
on the [QCFractal issue tracker](https://github.com/MolSSI/QCFractal/issues/new/choose) 
for the `interface`. Issues about the documentation, repository structure, or deployment 
of the standalone QCPortal can be raised on this repository.
