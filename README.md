A client interface to the QC Archive Project.

This standalone client serves to hook into QCFractal instances from remote or local 
locations and is designed for end-users who which to access the QCFractal stores.

### Issues

All issues should be reported to the [QCFractal issue tracker](https://github.com/MolSSI/QCFractal/issues/new/choose).
This repository is automatically updated from the main QCFractal source code and is only used for deployment of the QCPortal package.

### QCPortal Version descriptions with QCFractal

QCPortal's release versions mostly match QCFractal's releases with the following standard form

```X.Y.Z```

for Major (X), Minor(Y), and Patch(Z) version respectively. However, because Portal is intrinsicly linked to
Fractal, the following rules must be adhered to:
1. Major release version **must** be the same as Fractal
2. Minor release version **must** be the same as Fractal
3. Patch version is unrestricted and can differ from Fractal
