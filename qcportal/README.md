QC Portal
=========

A client interface to the QC Archive project.

This module is acessible through the semi-auto compiled [QCPortal](https://github.com/molssi/qcportal)
project as `qcportal`; this is the most common use case for end-users and those 
 who want to access a remote QCFractal instance. 
 
Alternatively, it can be imported as part of [QCFractal](https://github.com/molssi/qcfractal) directly as the `interface` module; 
this is the primary way developers and those who manage their own QCFractal instances will 
access it.

This module specifically (`interface` on QCFractal) is automatically ported to the 
QCPortal repository as the main source code of QCPortal.

This folder should not use modules above this level.
